## Web Monetization for Defold

This repository contains a Defold [native extension](https://www.defold.com/manuals/extensions/) which integrates the Web Monetization JavaScript API. This allows game developers to detect if a player has an active payment stream or not and offer additional content or perks to paying players.

[Manual, API and setup instructions](https://www.defold.com/extension-webmonetization/) is available on the official Defold site.
